# Cronan — GitHub Profile README

This repo contains a single `README.md` displayed on my GitHub profile (github.com/Cronan).

## Purpose

Professional first impression for GitHub visitors. Links to my writing and personal site (cronyn.co.uk).

## Conventions

- British English. No em-dashes.
- No promotional language. Understated, factual.
- No emojis. No exclamation marks.
- Do not name my employer directly. Say "Man Group" if needed, but prefer describing the role.
- Keep it concise. This is a profile card, not a CV.

## Git

- Default branch: `main`.
- All commits authored by me (Ivan Cronyn), not Claude.
