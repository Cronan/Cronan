### Ivan Cronyn

Principal Engineer & Head of Solutions Technology at [Man Group](https://www.man.com/). I lead the engineering function for Man Solutions' bespoke investment mandates - portfolio optimisation, client reporting, and the tools that support new business.

I've been writing code since 1981, starting on a Sinclair ZX81 in Durban, South Africa. Career path: Barclays Capital → Merrill Lynch → GLG Partners → Brevan Howard → Man Group. Mostly C++, C#, and Python.

Right now I'm thinking about how AI is changing the way we build and maintain financial software. The capability is impressive. The bottleneck is trust.

**Writing:**
- [Trust, not capability](https://cronyn.co.uk/writing/trust-not-capability.html) - the real constraint on AI in production engineering
- [Building engineers in the age of AI](https://cronyn.co.uk/writing/ai-as-junior-engineer.html) - talent development when AI does the reps
- [Bainbridge's Ironies of Automation](https://cronyn.co.uk/writing/ironies-of-automation.html) - a 1983 paper that maps precisely onto today
